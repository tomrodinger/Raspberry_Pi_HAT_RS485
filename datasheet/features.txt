Single adapter links a Raspberry Pi (Zero, 3, 4), Arduino, ESP32, Mac, PC, or any serial host to a daisy chain of smart servomotors.
Automatically switches between transmit and receive, so code only sends a command and listens for the reply.
Bright LEDs to indicate board power, transmit, and receive.
Supports bit rates up to 1 Mbps (servomotors typically run at 230400 baud) for high performant demos and projects.
RS485 differential signaling keeps communication relianble in electrically noisy labs, maker spaces, classrooms, or industrial settings.
One master controller can address multiple servos on the shared bus, reducing wiring clutter on projects.
Keeps cost of projects low. Only one adapter is needed for controlling multiple servomotors.
Includes both USB-C and Micro-USB connectors to match the cables students already have on hand.
Can plug directly onto a Raspberry Pi as a low-profile hat for wire-free stacking.
Fully open source design so educators and students can review the schematic and adapt it for their builds.
